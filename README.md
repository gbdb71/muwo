48 hour compo entry puzzle game for Ludum Dare

- Use cooperative robots to put the red ball in the circle. 
- Use as few robots as possible on each level. 
- Don't let the ball fall in the pits. 
- Have fun :) 

Left click : add/rotate a robot. 
Right click: remove a robot. 
Space: start/next/retry. 

Works best in Chrome, barely in Firefox and probably not at all everywhere else, sorry.
